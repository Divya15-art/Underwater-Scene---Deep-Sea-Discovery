                <p><a href='https://unsplash.com/' target='_blank'></a>.</p>
                <p>Water is the primary and essential need of every living organism. It is the most precious gift by
                    nature
                    that helps in survival. 70% of our body is filled with water, which is why it is an essential part
                    of
                    our life. Water is needed for various purposes every day.It is a transparent, odorless, tasteless
                    liquid, and a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

                        <p>An underwater environment is a environment of, and immersed in, liquid water in a natural or
                            artificial feature (called a body of water), such as an ocean, sea, lake, pond, reservoir,
                            river, canal, or aquifer. Some characteristics of the underwater environment are universal,
                            but
                            many depend on the local situation.Marine life can be roughly grouped into autotrophs and
                            heterotrophs according to their roles within the food web: the former include photosynthetic
                            and
                            the much rarer chemosynthetic organisms (chemoautotrophs) that can convert inorganic
                            molecules
                            into organic compounds using energy from sunlight or exothermic oxidation ...</p><a

                <h2>Ocean Pollution !</h2>
                <p>Ocean pollution is a serious environmental issue that threatens the health of the planet and its
                    marine ecosystems:
                    Causes
                <p>Billions of pounds of trash and other pollutants enter the ocean each year from many sources,
                    including:</p>
                <p>Land-based activities: Accidental spills, deliberate dumping, untreated effluent, atmospheric
                    fall-out, and run-off from
                    drains and rivers</p>
                <p>Marine sources: Fishing nets, ropes, and fleets</p>
                <p>Other sources: Oil spills, fertilizer from yards, and noise from shipping and drilling</p>
                <p>Effects !</p>
                <p>Ocean pollution has far-reaching consequences, including:</p>
                <p>Degrading the health of the ocean: Oceans are being bombarded with pollution that degrades their
                    health at an alarming
                    rate</p>
                <p>Harming marine life: Toxic substances like heavy metals, oil spills, and pesticides can cause
                    deformities, reproductive
                    problems, and even death in fish and other aquatic organisms</p>
                <p>Threatening human health: Polluted water can cause diseases like typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and
                    cancer</p>
                <p>Impacting the food chain</p>
                <p>Toxins in the water bodies are consumed by aquatic animals, which are then consumed by humans
                <p>Creating floating garbage patches</p>
                <p>Rubbish in the seas clumps together to form vast floating garbage patches all over the world, such as
                    the Great Pacific
                    Garbage Patch</p>
